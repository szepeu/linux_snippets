Functions, aliases and other quirks and features to help with linux

This repository consists of small changes, that help me working with Linux systems, especially embedded ones, where I don't want to install additional packages to do some things, but I'd like to have improved terminal experience. Pull if you want, I especially like the "l" and "swap".
